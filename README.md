## Problem Statement
The one problem that we see in the healthcare industry is the unwanted wastage of time. As you move from one hospital to another, they used to tell us to go for medical scans again. In medical conditions such as mental health or heart related issues, time is very crucial. To save that time we can make a centralized repository which can provide relevant data to the correct stakeholder and hide the unnecessary and private data.

## Novelity
Every big healthcare facility is maintaining data at their end and provide a medical history of the patient. The problem is that their data is not accessible outside their organisation. So, in case a patient is moving to some other hospital they may not have their medical history or they have to carry a bunch of papers.
We will solve that problem by creating a platform where all the stakeholders will come together and contribute to the central repository. The data collected will then be used as a medical history that can be used anywhere across the globe.
